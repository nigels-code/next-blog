# NextBlog

I wrote this while following Maximilian Schwarzmuller's "Next.js and React" course.

A Single Page Application using Next.js, React, Context API, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML

I have connected this repo to Vercel.  
Open <http://.vercel.app/> to see the project in production.

## Installation

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn dev
```

This runs the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.

Database functions won't work in development mode because the mongodb username and password are stored as environment variables and are not under source control.
